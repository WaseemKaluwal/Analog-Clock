# Analog Clock in Python  

## Overview  
This is a simple **Analog Clock** built with **Python** using the **Tkinter** library for graphical user interface (GUI) design and **math** for accurate time calculations. The clock displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands, providing a clean and interactive analog-style clock.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Clock**: Displays the current time in an analog format.  
- **Hour, Minute, and Second Hands**: Accurate and real-time movement of the clock hands.  
- **Simple User Interface**: A minimalistic design using Tkinter for easy use.  
- **Customizable Clock Face**: Ability to change the clock's size, colors, and style if needed.  
- **Smooth Movement**: Continuous and fluid movement of the clock hands.  

## System Requirements  
- **Python 3.7+**  
- **Tkinter** (comes pre-installed with most Python distributions)  

## How It Works  
- The clock is rendered using **Tkinter Canvas**, and the positions of the hour, minute, and second hands are calculated based on the current system time.  
- The clock continuously updates using the **`after()`** method in Tkinter to update every second, ensuring real-time accuracy.  

## Future Enhancements  
- **Digital Clock Option**: Add an option to toggle between analog and digital clocks.  
- **Alarm Functionality**: Set alarms and get notifications at specified times.  
- **Customizable Clock Themes**: Add multiple color schemes or themes for the clock.  
- **Resizable Clock**: Allow resizing of the clock window while maintaining proportions.
